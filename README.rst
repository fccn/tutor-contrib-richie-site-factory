Richie site factory plugin for `Tutor <https://docs.tutor.overhang.io>`__
============================================================

This is a plugin to integrate multiple `Richie <https://richie.education/>`__ sites, the learning portal CMS, with `Open edX <https://open.edx.org>`__. The integration takes the form of a `Tutor <https://docs.tutor.overhang.io>`__ plugin.

Dependencies
------------

You should have create your own Richie site factory, go to https://richie.education/docs/cookiecutter/ to know more about it.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install tutor-contrib-richie
    tutor plugins enable richie

Running the Richie plugin will require that you rebuild the "openedx" Docker image::

    tutor config save
    tutor images build openedx

This step is necessary to install the Richie connector app in edx-platform.

Then, the platform can be launched as usual with::

    tutor local quickstart

This plugins allows to run multiple Richie instance sites. So you have to configure each site factory sites so each can be run inside Tutor.

Gettting started
----------------

Once your Richie platform is up and running, you will quickly realize that your learning portal is empty. This is because you should first create the corresponding courses and organizations from inside Richie. To do so, start by creating a super user::

    tutor local run richie python manage.py createsuperuser

You can then use the credentials you just created at http(s)://yourrichiehost/admin. In development, this is http://courses.local.overhang.io/admin.

Then, refer to the official `Richie documentation <https://richie.education/docs/quick-start>`__ to learn how to create courses and organizations.

You may also want to fill your learning portal with a demo site -- but be careful not to run this command in production, as it will be difficult to get rid of the demo site afterwards::

    # WARNING: do not attempt this in production!
    tutor local run richie-<mysite> python manage.py create_demo_site --force

Configuration
-------------

This Tutor plugin comes with a few configuration settings:

- ``RICHIE_RELEASE_VERSION`` (default: ``"v1.27.1"``) - the default version of the demo site
- ``RICHIE_HOST`` (default: ``"courses.{{ LMS_HOST }}"``) - the marketing domain name at which the Open edX will be configured

Other are per site, replace the `{site}` with the name of your site:

- ``RICHIE_{site}_MYSQL_DATABASE`` (default: ``"richie-{site}"``)
- ``RICHIE_{site}_MYSQL_USERNAME`` (default: ``"richie-{site}"``)
- ``RICHIE_{site}_HOST`` (default: ``"{site}.{{LMS_HOST}}"``)
- ``RICHIE_{site}_DOCKER_IMAGE`` the fun-mooc demo instance image
- ``RICHIE_{site}_BUCKET_NAME`` (default: ``"richie-{site}-uploads"``)
- ``RICHIE_{site}_MEDIA_BUCKET_NAME`` (default: ``"richie-{site}-media"``)
- ``RICHIE_{site}_ELASTICSEARCH_INDICES_PREFIX`` (default: ``"richie-{site}"``)

If you need to completely customize the `production` environment, you can use the Tutor patch `richie-{{site}}-production-env`.

These defaults should be enough for most users. To modify any one of them, run::

    tutor config save --set RICHIE_SETTING_NAME=myvalue

For instance, to customize the domain name at which Richie will run::

    tutor config save --set "RICHIE_HOST=mysubdomain.{{ LMS_HOST }}"

Development
-----------

Bind-mount volume::

    tutor dev bindmount richie /app/richie

Then, run a development server::

    tutor dev runserver --volume=/app/richie richie

The Richie development server will be available at http://courses.local.overhang.io:8003.
